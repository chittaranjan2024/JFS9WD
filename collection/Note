Vector:
Synchronized or thread safe leads to slow processing speed

Stack:

HashSet:
HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
HashSet contains unique elements only.
HashSet allows null value.
HashSet class is non synchronized.
HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
HashSet is the best approach for search operations.

LinkedHashSet:
Java LinkedHashSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java LinkedHashSet class provides all optional set operations and permits null elements.
Java LinkedHashSet class is non-synchronized.
Java LinkedHashSet class maintains insertion order.

Tree Set:
Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quite fast.
Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null elements.
Java TreeSet class is non-synchronized.
Java TreeSet class maintains ascending order.
The TreeSet can only allow those generic types that are comparable. For example The Comparable interface is being implemented by the StringBuffer class.
